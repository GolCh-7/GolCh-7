## Hi, I'm Golam Choudhury. 

Currently, I am a automation testing specialist with a UK based private bank. The main methods of testing used at this particular institution are manual testing and automation testing using UiPath. 

Although university degree is in Aeronautical Engineering, I  had decied to pivot into the world of programming shortly after graduation in 2020. 
I am continuously building my skills in order to establish myself within this space. 

My journey in technology started with teaching myself core Python, which I was first introduced to during my time in University. I then moved onto training to become a Java SDET consultant. 
This training exposed to me to numerous different tehcnologies and testing concepts necessary for becoming an automation testing specialist using Java. Off the back of this training, I was able to gain various assignments. 
These real-world experiences have added to my skillset by exposing me to additional disciplines such as data engineering using Python and automation using enterprise tools such as Tosca. 

Outside of my current role for work, I also enjoy learning other disciplines within programming and technology. Currently, I am learning about Web Development and Data Science. Back-End web development has particularly gained my interest.

I have a number of skills and interests, here are just a few:
- Core Python
- Core Java
- Pandas
- Django
- Selenium WebDriver
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- React
- Tricentis Tosca
